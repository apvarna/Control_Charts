# Control_Charts

This project focuses on identifying samples that are out of control in a process using statistical control chart rules. Below is a summary of the key control rules used to evaluate process stability:

### Control Rules
**Rule 1**: A process is considered out of control if a single point falls outside the control limits.

**Rule 2**: A process is considered out of control if two out of three consecutive points fall outside the two standard deviation warning limits on the same side of the centerline.

**Rule 3**: A process is considered out of control if four out of five consecutive points fall beyond the one standard deviation limit on the same side of the centerline.

**Rule 4**: A process is considered out of control if nine or more consecutive points fall on one side of the centerline.

**Rule 5**: A process is considered out of control if there is a run of six or more consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing.

### Goal
The primary goal of this analysis was to evaluate process stability by detecting violations of Rule 2 and Rule 4. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support better decision-making in operational analytics and process improvement.
